Collaboration Policy
--------------------

We encourage working together whenever possible: in the tutorials, problem sets, and general discussion of the material and assignments.

Keep in mind, however, that for the problem sets the solutions you hand in should reflect your _own_ understanding of the class material and _should be written solely by you_. It is not acceptable to copy a solution that somebody else has written.
